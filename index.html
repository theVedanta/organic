                <p>
                    Sikkim is the first state in the world that is 100% organic: All of its farmland is certified organic. The policy
                    implemented a phase-out of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, and achieved a total ban on sale and use of chemical
                    pesticides in the state. The transition has benefitted more than 66,000 farming families.

                        <p>
                            This is a system of growing different kinds of crops in recurrent succession on the same land.
                            It helps to improve ferility in land
                        </p>
                        <p class="extra">
                            For example, say a farmer has planted a field of corn. When the corn harvest is finished, he might plant beans, since
                            corn consumes a lot of nitrogen and beans return nitrogen to the soil. A simple rotation might involve two or three crops, and complex rotations might incorporate a dozen or more.
                            If a farmer plants the exact same crop in the same place every year, as is common in conventional farming, she
                            continually draws the same nutrients out of the soil. Pests and diseases happily make themselves a permanent home as
                            their preferred food source is guaranteed. With monocultures like these, increasing levels of chemical fertilizers and
                            pesticides become necessary to keep yields high while keeping bugs and disease at bay.

                        <p>
                            Green manures are grown primarily for reasons other than short-term economic gain. In other words, they
                            are not produced for sale, but rather for the benefits they provide to the production of subsequent cash crops.
                        </p>
                        <p class="extra">
                            The use of green manure cover crops is a popular practice among many growers in the farming and agricultural industries.
                            This method of organic fertilizing has numerous benefits for the home gardener as well.
                            The growing and turning of green manure cover crops provides additional nutrients and organic matter to the soil. When
                            incorporated into the soil, these plants break down, eventually releasing important nutrients, such as nitrogen, that
                            are necessary for adequate plant growth. It also increases soil drainage and water retention capabilities. In addition
                            to adding nutrients and organic materials to the soil, green manure crops can be grown to scavenge leftover nutrients
                            following the harvest season. This helps prevent leaching, soil erosion, and weed growth.

                            Composting isn't as hard (or as smelly) as you've been led to believe. Anyone can compost in any location, as long as
                            they understand the basics of this all-natural process. When the food in your trash goes to a landfill, it emits methane, a greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change.
                            Composting is a way to minimize those methane emissions, but it does a lot more than that. Because compost is used as a
                            fertilizer, it reduces the need for chemical options, which can be harsh on the earth. According to the EPA, compost is
                            also capable of capturing and eliminating 99.6 percent of volatile organic compounds, or VOCs, from the air. These
                            vapors and gases can have a harmful impact on your health, with side effects ranging from nausea to throat irritation.

                            Cover crops are typically grasses or legumes but may be comprised of other green plants. Most often, a cover
                            crop is
                            grown in the off-season before the field is needed for growing the cash crop. In essence, a cover crop
                            readies the
                            land for an incoming cash crop. Cover crops have a surprisingly wide array of benefits and no serious
                            drawbacks. A cover crop can improve the health of
                            your soil, resulting in a significantly larger, healthier cash crop for the next growing season. Cover crops
                            are an important part of sustainable agriculture. These crops add fertility to the soil without chemical
                            fertilizers via biological nitrogen fixation.

                        <p class="extra">
                            In agriculture, pests are kept at bay by cultural, chemical and biological means. Ploughing and cultivation

                            possible.
                            This can be achieved by monitoring the crop, only applying insecticides when necessary, and by growing
                            varieties and
                            crops which are resistant to pests. Where possible, biological means are used, encouraging the natural

                            The result of factor analysis showed that major barriers or obstacles to the adoption of organic farming
                            between farmers
                            were: productive, natural, attitude and knowledge, infrastructural, institutional and economical barriers.
                            These factors
                            explained about 68% of the total variance of the research variables. For organic farms, a buffer zone is an
                            area between certified organic production and non-organic land. Buffer zones
                            provide a dedicated area to prevent contamination.
